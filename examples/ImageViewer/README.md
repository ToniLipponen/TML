# TML - Image Viewer

Very simple image viewer demo application. You can either drag and drop images into the window, or copy and paste them with CTRL + V.
You can zoom in and out with mouse wheel, move the image with left click and drag. Press R to reset view.
Since this is just a demo and not a real application, it might be a bit rough around the edges. You can copy the code in its entirety and make your own improved version out of it.
